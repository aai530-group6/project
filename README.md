## Project Description

This project revolves around the PMData dataset, which includes health and fitness data collected from Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatches. The dataset comprises 2,440 activity sessions, over 20 million heart rate measurements, and additional wellness reports and sleep data. We aim to process this data using machine learning algorithms to provide insights into users' health and predict potential health disorders.
