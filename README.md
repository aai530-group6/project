## Project Introduction/Objective

The aim of this project is to design and implement a sophisticated system that leverages wearable technology data, specifically from Fitbit devices, to analyze and predict sleep quality in real-time. By integrating advanced machine learning models with IoT data, we seek to offer personalized insights into sleep patterns, thereby empowering individuals to enhance their sleep hygiene and overall well-being. This initiative addresses the critical need for innovative solutions in sleep health management and has the potential to make a significant impact on personal health monitoring practices.

## Project Description

Centered around the PMData dataset, this project harnesses health and fitness data collected from Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatches. The dataset encompasses 2,440 activity sessions, over 20 million heart rate measurements, alongside comprehensive wellness reports and detailed sleep data. Our objective is to employ machine learning algorithms to process this extensive dataset, aiming to uncover meaningful insights into sleep quality and predict potential sleep-related issues effectively.
